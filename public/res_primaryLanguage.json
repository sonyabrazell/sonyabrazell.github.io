Currently, there are no mainstream applications that help track both traditionally published books, as well as original works or fanworks. ReposiStory is a reading application that records a reader's personal library, and tracks both books and original works read. Readers are able to create an account, log in, and add books to their library, or search for books using the Google Books API. Readers can mark books as read, or add original works when completed. ReposiStory is able to provide both recommended books based on the reader's library, and data visualizations through Chart.js to track books, original works, and words read by month. ",
