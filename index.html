            <p>I'm Sonya. I'm a developer and designer based in Austin, Tx with my very own gaggle of people and pets. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I thrive in order and color, and I adore being able to play in the intersection between technical and visual. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I've always been the type of person who sees something and thinks to themselves, "I bet I could do 
                that." It's taken me on many adventures in my life, including joining the Navy at the age of 17, 
                attending college and completing my bachelor's degree while raising three children, starting a 
                business that sells products in over 50 shops around the world, and now taking a chance and 
                starting all over again.
